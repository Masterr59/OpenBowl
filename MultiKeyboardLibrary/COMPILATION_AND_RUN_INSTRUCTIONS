While the java files can be compiled normally in netbeans, the C file cannot.

Integrating these complex compilation steps into ANT is difficult (maybe impossible), so a manual approach was taken.



Compilation instructions:

1. Compile (build) like normal in NetBeans (weird stuff might happen if you don't compile the Java before the C)

2. Go to MultiKeyboardLibrary/src/OpenBowl.MultiKeyboardLibrary/classes and run the script named "compile" in a command line (type "./compile")

	You may have to manually change the JAVA_HOME and --module-path paths in the script first. Open the script with your favorite text editor.

		JAVA_HOME is the location of your java installation. Example: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-armhf

		The --module-path path is given to you when you build in NetBeans. In the build output window, it will say something similar to
		
			To run this application from the command line without Ant, try:
			/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-armhf/bin/java -modulepath /home/pi/Documents/CollegeStuff/ClassFiles/Winter2020/CSCD488/OpenBowl-BrianBranch/MultiKeyboardLibrary/build/modules org.openbowl.multikeyboardlibrary.MultiKeyboardInputReader

		Note: There are apparently standardization issues concerning whether or not the modulepath flag is called "-modulepath" or "--module-path". The compile script uses --module-path.

3. A file named libmultikeyboardinputreader.so should have been created in the same directory as the compile script.
   Cut and paste this file from its original location to MultiKeyboardLibrary/build/modules/OpenBowl.MultiKeyboardLibrary


Run instructions (for the demo contained in MultiKeyboardInputReader's main method):

1. After you have followed the compilation steps above, go to MultiKeyboardLibrary/build/modules/OpenBowl.MultiKeyboardLibrary
   and run the script named "runDemo" in the command line (type "./runDemo")

	You may have to manually change the "java" and --module-path paths in the script first. Open the script with your favorite text editor.

	Note: There are apparently standardization issues concerning whether or not the modulepath flag is called "-modulepath" or "--module-path". The runDemo script uses --module-path.
