Run instructions (release version):

1. After you have followed the compilation steps in the multi-keyboard library's COMPILE_INSTRUCTIONS file (if necessary),
   go to MultiKeyboardLibrary/Demo/ReleaseVersion/build/modules/OpenBowl.MultiKeyboardLibraryDemo and run the script named
   "runDemo" in the command line (type "./runDemo")

2. The demo class main main method optionally takes one or more integer command-line arguments representing
   which specific device event numbers should be polled. If omitted, the demo defaults to polling all devices
   returned by getKeyboardIdentificationData().

   If needed, place these numbers at the end of the "java" command in the runDemo script.
