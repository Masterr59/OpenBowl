Run instructions (debug release):

1. After you have followed the compilation steps in the multi-keyboard library's COMPILE_INSTRUCTIONS file (if necessary),
   go to MultiKeyboardLibrary/Demo/DebugVersion/build/modules/OpenBowl.MultiKeyboardLibraryDemo and run the script named
   "runDemo" in the command line (type "./runDemo")

2. The demo class main main method optionally takes one or more integer command-line arguments representing
   which specific device event numbers should be polled. If omitted, the demo defaults to polling all devices
   returned by getKeyboardIdentificationData().

   There is a required first command-line argument specifying whether or not non-key input events are returned to the device queues.
   This argument must either be "true" (non-key input events are returned) or "false" (non-key input events are not returned).

   If needed, place device event number parameters at the end of the "java" command in the runDemo script.
