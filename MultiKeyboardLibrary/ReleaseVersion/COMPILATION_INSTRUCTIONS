While the java files can be compiled normally in netbeans, the C file cannot.

Integrating these complex compilation steps into ANT is difficult (maybe impossible), so a manual approach was taken.



Compilation instructions:

1. Compile (build) like normal in NetBeans (weird stuff might happen if you don't compile the Java before the C)

2. Go to MultiKeyboardLibrary/ReleaseVersion/src/OpenBowl.MultiKeyboardLibrary/classes and run the script named "compile" in a command line (type "./compile")

	You may have to manually change the JAVA_HOME path in the script first. Open the script with your favorite text editor.

		JAVA_HOME is the location of your java installation. Example: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-armhf

	There are apparently standardization issues concerning whether or not the modulepath flag is called "-modulepath" or "--module-path". The compile script uses --module-path.

3. A file named libmultikeyboardinputreader.so should have been created in the same directory as the compile script.
   Cut and paste this file from its original location to MultiKeyboardLibrary/ReleaseVersion/dist
